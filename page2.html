    <h5>Review grammatical or typographical errors.</h5>


    <h5>Be on the lookout for poor grammar or typographical errors. Many phishing e-mails are translated from other languages or are sent without being proof-read. As a result, these messages can contain bad grammar or typographical errors.</h5>

<h5>Check the return address: Is the e-mail from Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk or from a "phisher"? Genuine e-mails come from an e-mail address ending in "@amazon.com", "@amazon.lu" or "@amazon.co.uk". While phishers often send forged e-mails to make it look like it comes from Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk, you can frequently determine whether it's authentic by checking the return address. If the "from" line of the e-mail looks like "amazon-security@hotmail.com" or "amazon-payments@msn.com", or contains the name of another Internet Service Provider (ISP), you can be sure it is a fraudulent e-mail. Most e-mail clients let you examine the source of the e-mail. Check the e-mail header information to see that the "received from", "reply to", and "return path" for the e-mail comes from @amazon.com or @amazon.co.uk. The method you use to check the header information varies depending on the e-mail client you use.</h5>

<h5>Check the website address: Some phishers set up spoof websites that contain the word "amazon" somewhere in the URL. Genuine Amazon websites always end with ".amazon.com" or ".amazon.co.uk". We never use a combination such as "security-amazon.com" or "amazon.com.biz". Some phishing e-mails include a link that looks as though it will take you to your account, but it is really a shortened link to a completely different website. If you hover over the link in your e-mail client, you can sometimes see the underlying, false Web address, either as a popup or as information in the browser status bar.</h5>
